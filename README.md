# Project Title : 
Predict the fish species via REST API based on the fish market sales dataset
# Problem Statement :
There are seven fish species in the fish market dataset, and the dataset was recorded in terms of biometric sizes. Seven researchers in the Kaggle website worked on the fish market dataset with different approaches. Unfortunately, the researchers did not find the best model in terms of accuracy for the dataset. The aim of this project is to find the best model with the highest accuracy and embeded in a web based application for educational purposes.
